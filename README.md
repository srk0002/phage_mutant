# Parent Isolate and Bacteriophage-Resistant Isolate of Salmonella Newport
A bacteriophage-resistant isolate of a multi-drug resistant isolate of Salmonella Newport was generated to see if phage-resistance would attenuate or increase virulence of a multi-drug resistant Salmonella Newport.
A single phage (S50) was used as selective pressure on a overnight susceptible culture of S. Newport. The mutant isolate was selected for and was resistant to four out of five of our phage from our S. Newport phage cocktail.
